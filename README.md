In this project, I use survey data of approximately 20,000 people sampled from the United States to explore health behavior associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI).

Incorporating survey design methods, I use multiple regression to handle confounders when testinh whether physical activity is associated with lower BMI. 

This project uses National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from approximately 20,000 participants surveyed in years 2009 - 2012 found in the NHANES R package.
